# The Imposter

👋 Hi, I’m @ImposterCoder42.\
Allow me to introduce myself and this page.  I am a mostly self-taught developer.\
I first started writing code in 2019.  What started as pursuit of better career,\
quickly became a long lasting passion.\
Unfortunately, I was never successful in this career change.  As of late I have\
decided to pursue this more as a hobby.

### The Goal
The only real goal is to inspire others take on new challenges.\
Who knows? Maybe create a small community of people who wish to learn\
and grow as "pretendineers".

### 👀 Other Hobbies
- Snowboarding
- Motorcycles
- CAD
- 3D Printing
  
### 🌱 I’m currently learning
- ROS2 Jazzy
- Machine Learning
- OpenCV
- Computer Vision
- Python
- C++
- CAD
- Mechanical / Electrical Engineering
- Content Creation

Guess which one!
